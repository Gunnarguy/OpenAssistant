The messages are encoded and decoded using JSON serialization to persist them between sessions.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | OpenAssistant/Chat/MessageStore.swift              |
| ChatContentView.swift           | The `ChatContentView` struct defines the UI layout for a chat interface using SwiftUI. It includes a message list, an input view for sending messages, and displays a progress view and step counter. The view adjusts to the color scheme provided and is structured within a vertical stack. The code observes changes in the view model and message store to update the UI accordingly.                                                                                                                                                              | OpenAssistant/Chat/ChatContentView.swift           |
| ChatView.swift                  | The code defines a SwiftUI view, `ChatView`, for displaying a chat UI. It uses `ChatViewModel` and `MessageStore` to manage data. The view includes a navigation bar displaying the assistant's name and a link to view chat history. It also handles error messages with an alert. The preview provider allows testing the view with mock data.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | OpenAssistant/Chat/ChatView.swift                  |
| NewCustomLoadingIndicator.swift | This code snippet defines a SwiftUI custom progress view, `CustomProgressView`, that visually represents a progress indicator with a circular tracker. The progress is determined by `stepCounter`, and the circle fills up based on the ratio of `stepCounter` to 6. The view includes text showing the steps completed out of a total of 6. This creates a visual representation of progress with a dynamic circular fill effect based on the provided `stepCounter` value.                                                                           | OpenAssistant/Chat/NewCustomLoadingIndicator.swift |
| ChatHistoryView.swift           | The provided code snippet contains SwiftUI structures to display a chat history. `ChatHistoryView` renders a list of messages filtered by the `assistantId`, using the `MessageRow` for each message. Each `MessageRow` displays the sender ("You" or "Assistant") and the text content if available. The UI is designed to present a clean chat history interface with messages sorted by sender type.                                                                                                                                                 | OpenAssistant/Chat/ChatHistoryView.swift           |
| InputView.swift                 | This code defines a SwiftUI `InputView` used for inputting messages. It includes a text field for typing messages, a send button, and a clock icon linked to a chat history view. The view reacts to changes in the `ChatViewModel` and `MessageStore`, and allows users to send messages and view chat history. The design incorporates specific styling, such as rounded corners, shadows, and color schemes.                                                                                                                                         | OpenAssistant/Chat/InputView.swift                 |
| MessageView.swift               | The provided code defines two SwiftUI views: `MessageView` and `MessageBubble`. `MessageView` displays a message bubble based on the `Message` model for either a user or received message, aligning them to the left or right accordingly. `MessageBubble` presents the message content with customizable background color and text color, adjusting based on the role and color scheme. Overall, these views facilitate the visual representation of messages, incorporating dynamic styling properties based on the message sender and color scheme. | OpenAssistant/Chat/MessageView.swift               |

| VectorStoreManagerViewModel.swift | The provided code snippet defines a SwiftUI ViewModel class, VectorStoreManagerViewModel, that manages interactions with an API for vector store management. It includes functions for fetching, updating, and deleting vector stores and their related files. The ViewModel uses Combine for networking and data handling tasks, along with async/await for asynchronous operations. Additionally, it handles errors, displays notifications, and features functions for adding and removing vector store IDs from assistants. | OpenAssistant/VectorStores/VectorStoreManagerViewModel.swift |
| FileDetailView.swift              | The provided code snippet presents a SwiftUI view named `FileDetailView` that displays the details of a `VectorStoreFile`. It includes sections for key file information like ID, object, usage bytes, timestamps, and chunking strategy if available. Helper methods are used for formatting dates and bytes, and structured views are generated using SwiftUI components like Lists, Sections, and Text elements. Additionally, logging of file data upon view appearance is implemented through the `.onAppear` modifier.    | OpenAssistant/VectorStores/FileDetailView.swift              |
| VectorStoreDetailView.swift       | The provided code snippet defines a SwiftUI view, `VectorStoreDetailView`, to display details of a `VectorStore`.

It leverages Combine for data fetching and bindings for managing state. Additional support includes an alert system and helper methods for date formatting and byte conversion.                                                                                           | OpenAssistant/VectorStores/VectorStoreDetailView.swift       |
| VectorStoreListView.swift         | This code snippet defines a SwiftUI view for managing a list of vector stores, supporting creating, viewing, and deleting operations. The view fetches vector store data from a ViewModel, allows creating new stores, and displays detailed information for each store using a separate row view. Additionally, error handling and refreshing functionalities are included, providing a comprehensive interface for handling vector stores.                                                                                    | OpenAssistant/VectorStores/VectorStoreListView.swift         |
| AddFileView.swift                 | The code snippet defines a SwiftUI view for file selection and upload. It allows users to select multiple files, displays the selected files, and provides buttons to trigger the file upload process. The uploading logic includes handling file size limits, retry attempts, and displays success/failure summaries through async operations and swift concurrency. Additionally, error handling is implemented to notify users of any upload issues.                                                                         | OpenAssistant/VectorStores/AddFileView.swift                 |
