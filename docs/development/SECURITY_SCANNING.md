# Disabling CodeQL

If you want to disable CodeQL scanning:

## Option 1: Delete the workflow file
```bash
rm .github/workflows/codeql.yml
rm -rf .github/codeql/
```

## Option 2: Disable in GitHub Settings
1. Go to your repo on GitHub
2. Settings â†’ Security & analysis
3. Turn off "Code scanning alerts"

## Option 3: Keep but ignore alerts
- Keep the scanning active
- Just ignore the security alerts in GitHub

## Why I Recommend Keeping It:
- **Free security monitoring**
- **Catches real vulnerabilities** 
- **Industry standard practice**
- **Helps with App Store security reviews**
- **No impact on your development workflow**

The warnings you saw are likely just configuration issues that the new setup will fix!
