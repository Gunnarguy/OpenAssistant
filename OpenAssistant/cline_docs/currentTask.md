# Current Task

## Objective
Fix App Store rejection issues for OpenAssistant app (Version 2.4, Build 118)

## Context
The app was rejected from the App Store with the following issues:
1. Missing CFBundleIconName key in Info.plist
2. Missing 120x120 pixel app icon for iPhone/iPod Touch

These issues prevent the app from being published on the App Store and need to be resolved before resubmission.

## Completed Steps
1. Added the CFBundleIconName key to Info.plist with value "AppIcon"
2. Created a 1024x1024 pixel app icon from the provided image
3. Simplified the app icon's Contents.json file to use the new iOS unified app icon format
4. Renamed the icon file to AppIcon.png for clarity and consistency

## Next Steps
1. Verify all changes with Xcode to ensure compatibility
2. Build the app and submit the new binary to App Store Connect
3. Monitor the app review process to ensure approval
